Project overview:
Pogo is essentially a personalized, student-first event discovery platform that focuses on helping users easily find and save local events tailored to their interests and accessibility needs. It repackages event advertisments found happening accross Auckaland, and showcases it on a centralized, student-designed platform. The platform is designed to make event browsing feel fun, exciting, and less intimidating and overwhelming for the user. 


What problem does it solve, or what inspired it?
This solution was prompted by a personal problem I had experienced. I had decided to go to an event with a friend [it was a night market], and I went around 20 minutes after the start, but no one was there. Me and my friend kept going back and checking if the event had just started late, but no one was setting up at all. A few hours after coming home, I checked the events Instagram page again, and saw that they only just posted a notice for the location and date change.
The key issue I along with the target audience faced were things like unreliable updates, not feeling like event advertisments they saw was targeted to them, and finding out about events too late. This platform helps solve these issues by reccomending events that are more tailored to each user, as well as being shown from whats happening the soonest to the top, based on what they set up during the filter process. Users can also edit filters whenever they like again, through the home screens or the account screen (not just limited to editing during the account creation flow). This allows users to not just see events that are happening, but rather, see events they would realistically be interested in participating in.


Main user flows / key features implemented 
- Sign up user flow : customizing your experience 
- Browse and Save user flow : keeping track of events that seems interesting for end user


Any known issues or limitations
CODED screens 
- Create Account flow
- Home [All, Interest Focused]
- Events [Bird Sketching]
Uncoded Screens 
- Sign in
- Home filters
- Unlisted events 
- Search
- Account
- Filter buttons do not affect the events displayed. If more time was available, I would try to implement a filter flow that actually affects the events displayed in the 'interest focused' screen. 

Future opportunities / If there was more development time 
If there was more time, I would want to add more interests (or maybe don't focus only on art events), fully develop all the screens, and choose mood filters that cover a wider group (currently just 'outdoors', 'chill', 'social', 'late night'). I am also interested in a potential notification feature for saved events as they approach the date, and an event share / RSVP with friends to encourage friend groups to attend together.
