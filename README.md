Project overview:
Pogo is essentially a personalized event discovery platform that focuses on helping users easily find and save local events tailored to their interests and accessibility needs. It repackages event advertisments found happening accross Auckaland, and showcases it on a centralized, student-designed platform. The platform is designed to make event browsing feel fun, exciting, and less intimidating and overwhelming for the user. 

What problem does it solve, or what inspired it?
This solution was prompted by a personal problem I had experienced. -
The key issue I along with the target audience faced were things like unreliable updates, and finding out about events too late. This platform helps solve this issue by reccomending events that are more tailored to each user, as well as being shown from whats happening the soonest to the top. 

Main user flows / key features implemented 
- Sign up user flow : customizing your experience 
- Browse and Save user flow : keeping track of events that seems interesting for end user

Any other Instructions

Any known issues or limitations
Coded screens 
- Create Account
- Home [All, Interest Focused]
- Events [Bird Sketching,     ]
Uncoded Screens 
- Sign in
- Search
- Unlisted events 
- Account
- Home filters

If there was more time, I would want to add more interests, fully develop all the screens, and choose mood filters that cover a wider group. I am also interested in a potential notification feature for saved events as they approach the date, and an event share / RSVP with friends to encourage friend groups to attend together.
