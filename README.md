Project overview: What is your project? What does it do?
Pogo is essentially a --. It repackages events advertisments found happening accross Auckaland, and showcases it on a centralized, student-designed platform. 

What problem does it solve, or what inspired it?
This solution was prompted by a personal problem I had experienced. -
The key issue I along with the target audience faced were things like unreliable updates, and finding out about events too late. This platform helps solve this issue by reccomending events that are more tailored to each user, as well as being shown from whats happening the soonest to the top. 

Main user flows / key features implemented 
- Sign up user flow : customizing your experience 
- Browse and Save user flow : keeping track of events that seems interesting for end user
- Mood filters : further filters, based on moods and vibes.
